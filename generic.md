<p>Hi there!</p>

<h2>US Navy Flight School</h2>
<h3>JAN 2023 - Present</h3>
<p>I'm currently a Student Naval Aviator.</p>

<h2>Naval Postgraduate School</h2>
<h3>JUN 2021 - JAN 2023</h3>
<p>I was fortunate to be given the opportunity to pursue a Masters of Science immediatly following the completion of my Bachelors of Science. I was competitivly selected amongst my peers going to flight school to attend the <a href="https://nps.edu" target="_blank">Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)</a>. At NPS, I studied <a href="https://nps.edu/web/or" target="_blank">Operations Research</a>. This is one of the oldest programs, with its origins dated back to World War II.</p>

<p>In order to graduate, each student must complete a thesis. My thesis was titled, "USING SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING METHODS TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE PROBABILITY OF FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIVITIES". I earned the <a href="https://www.mors.org/Professional-Development/Prizes/The-Tisdale-Graduate-Research-Prize" target="_blank">Military Operations Research Society (MORS) Steven A. Tisdale Award</a>, due to the thesis address an immediate or near-term need within the Department of Defense (DoD).</p>

<h2>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</h2>
<h3>AUG 2017 - MAY 2021</h3>
<p>I recieved a Naval Reserve Officer Training Crops (NROTC) scholarship to attend Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University to persue a Bachelors of Science in Aerospace Engineering. I graduated in May 2021, magna cum laude, with a B.S. Aerospace Engineering with a focus in Aeronautics. You can checkout some of my noteable projects from Embry-Riddle <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom, I was a member of the <a href="https://erauathletics.com/sports/mens-rowing">Men's Rowing Team</a> my entire four years. We participated in races across the Southeast United States.</p>

<p>On November 17, 2022 three of my peers and I presented the findings from our thesis at the quarterly MORS Tisdale conference at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). This award is given to the student who's thesis addresses the most immediate or short term need within the DoD. </p>

<p>My work focused on utilizing open-source event databases to attempt to predict what areas of the world will have an increase in violent events with fatalities. For a data source we used the <a href="https://acleddata.com" target="_blank">Armed Conflict Location and Event Database (ACLED)</a>. Additional data sources included <a href="https://data.worldbank.org" target="_blank">The World Bank</a> and the <a href="https://gecon.yale.edu" target="_blank">Yale Geographically Based Economic Database (G-Econ)</a>.</p>

<p>Research found that an esemble model provided the best performance, as well as the most insight into the predictors that effect the number of terrorist events with fatalities. The ensemble model consisted of two parts: a time-series forecasting of predictors and the prediction of whether an area is going to have an increase or decrease in violent events with fatalities. The important predictors can be found below.</p>

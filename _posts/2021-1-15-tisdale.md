<p>On November 17, 2022 three of my peers and I presented the findings from our thesis at the quarterly MORS Tisdale conference at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). This award is given to the student who's thesis addresses the most immediate or short term need within the DoD. </p>

<p>My work focused on utilizing open-source event databases to attempt to predict what areas of the world will have an increase in violent events with fatalities. For a data source we used the <a href="https://acleddata.com">Armed Conflict Location and Event Database (ACLED)</a>.</p>
